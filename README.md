For Part 2 of the Monthly Claim System, I have worked from Part 1 and implemented the requested functionalities using ASP.NET Core MVC Framework with a GUI (graphical user interface) which I didn’t implement in my part 1.
1)	 I tried designing a simple and intuitive form that lectures to submit claims. The form includes input fields for hours worked, hourly rate, and additional notes and I’ve added a clear and easy-to-click “Submit’ button to enhance the UX.
2)	 Lecturers can upload supporting documents such as PDF, DOCX, XLSX. Uploaded files are secured within the system and linked to the specific claim record, then included a type of restriction and a 5MB file limit size for validation and security.
3)	 I developed a separate Admin view where program coordinators or academic managers are able view, approve, or reject claims and each claim is displayed clearly including details, and added “Approve” and “Reject” button to simple workload.
4)	the system automatically updates and displays the claim status as Pending, Approved, or Rejected. Status updates are shown in real-time, ensuring transparency for both lecturers and mangers.
5)	Error Handling and Validation. Implemented input validation and exception handling throughout the application. Added user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or failed uploads to maintain system reliability.
6)	I incorporated some styling to make it look to be user-friendly, visually balanced, and intuitive to navigate. Used Entity Framework Core.
Overall, I crossed a lot of challenges and meet most of the requirements that has been asked.
